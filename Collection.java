/* Data Strcture:
--> Data Structurfe is a way of storing or organising the data.
-->In another words,data structure is the arrangement of the data.
-->Example:  stack,Queue,Array,Linked list,Tree,Graph.

collection:
--> collectin is predifined interface prfesent in java.util package.
-->collection was itroduced from jdk 1.2
--> collection is used to store a group of objects.

Difference between Array and collection:
----------------------------------------
			Array:												collection
-->Array is Homogeneous in nature.     -->collection is himogeneous and heterogeneous in nature.
--> Fixed size 						   -->Dynamic size.
-->No predefined method Present.	   -->many predefined methods present.
-->GFenerics not spported 			   -->Generic Supported.
-->No underlined data 				   --> Every collection asunderlined data structure.
   structure present. 
   
 Important methods present in collection interface
 --------------------------------------------------
  
   1. add(): is used to add an object on to the collection.
   2.addAll(): is usd to add 1 collection into another collection.
   3.contains(): is used to check if an object is present in the collection or not.
   4.containsAll():is used to check if 1 collectfion is present in another collection or not.
   5.remove(): is used to remove an object from the collection based on index position.
   6.removeAll(): is used to remove 1 collection from another collection.
   7.size():is used to count the number of objects present inside collection.(length)
   8.cler(): is used to rfemove all the objects from the collection.
   9.isEmpty(): is used to check if the collection is Emptyor not.
   
   
   List:
   -----
   --> list is a predefined interface present in java.util package.
   --> list was introduced from jdk 1.2.
   --> The implimentaion classes of the list interface are as follows:
   1.arralist  2.Vector  3.stack  4.linkedlist
   
   
   
   Specifications of list interface:
   ---------------------------------
   1. Insertion Order is maintain.
   2. Duplication is allowed.
   3. list is index based.
   4. Null values can be stored.
   
   
   Important methods preent in list interface:
   --------------------------------------------
   1. indexOf(): is used to find the index position of an object.
   2. lastindexof(): is used to find the last index of the object.
   3. get():is used to return thyr object based on the index position.
   4. add(index,value): is used to add an object in the specified index position but alredy existing object is 
     shifted  to next position.
   5. set(index,value): is used to add an object in the specified index position but already
      existing objects is overridden.
